How To run pyonenet
-------------------

To run the pyonenet commands you have to open the DOS command 
prompt and set the envinronment variables like before
try this :
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27;.
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.

you have to prepend "python" to every pyonenet commands.

To find the serial port available on windows type:
python ocm/scanwin32.py

and to communicate with the serial port (the board connected to it) type:
python ocm/miniterm.py

windows use different config files:

pyonenet.cfg      -> pyonenet_win.cfg
pyonenet-site.cfg -> pyonenet-site_win.cfg 

if you use default configuration you need C:\TEMP directory

in this release you cannot detach the process from terminal:
pyonenetd/pyonenetweb start do not work

you have to use:
python pyonenetd run 
python pyonenetweb run 

from http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/736635-daemon-under-windows :

"""
On Windows, you develop "services". They are under the control of the
"service control manager", and can be managed through the "services"
control panel application, and the "net start/stop" command line
utility.

In that architecture, you don't need fork to start a background
process, but instead, you register your service with the system, and
it will get started automatically (if you wish so) or manually
(through the management interface).

You can use the Win32 extensions to create services, with the
win32serviceutil module.
