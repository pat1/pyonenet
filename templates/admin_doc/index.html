<h1 id="pyonenet-1">PyOneNet</h1>

<p>
Pyonenet is developed on the one-net eval board and the Command-Line
Specification Version 1.6.2. http://one-net.info/
</p>
<p>
Pyonenet manage one or more one-net network. You need at last two eval
board: one master and one client.
</p>
<p>
Pyonenet can:

<ul>

<li> initialize the boards (set Network Id, channel and others)</li>
<li> create network (invite and join clients, remove ....)</li>
<li> memload and memdump to e from files</li>
<li> initialize a Data Base</li>
<li> insert boards into DataBase</li>
<li> memload and memdump to e from Data Base</li>
<li> send single commands to clients</li>
<li> listen for events from clients (pins changes)</li>
<li> minitor the one-net network from web</li>
<li> set pin state of clients from web</li>
<li> change the pin state to groups of clients with a time-based job
  scheduler: it enables users to schedule pins changes periodically at
  certain times or dates. This is done with a web interface</li>
<li> logging system to monitor the daemons</li>
<li> users and groups authorization system</li>
<li> master board configuration is mantained on the DataBase, so pyonenet
  is master fault error prone (you can change it without rebuild the
  network).  A client fault need to connect a new working client to
  the serial port to reload the config param from DB and save it to
  the flash memory on board</li>
<li> the pins client status is refreshed in configurable time periods to
  prevent a temporary fault on the clients </li>
<li> multilanguage web interface </li>

</ul>
</p>
